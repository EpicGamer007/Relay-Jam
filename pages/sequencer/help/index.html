			<h1>Whisker</h1>
			<h2>A simplistic and minimalistic music sequencer</h2>
			<p>According to wikipedia, a music sequencer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer">a device or application software that can record, edit, or play back music</a>.</p>
			<p>Whisker is just like that. It gives you an array of options to create your own music!</p>
			<p>There are multiple options you have for utilizing this sequencer. You get the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>

					</details>
