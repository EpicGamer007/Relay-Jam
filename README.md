# A showcase for the winning relay jam submissions perfected

INFO FOR Six and jdog, I have invited you to this repl, and from here we can work on perfecting our submissions :) and making them pog.

Copying over project from a Repl:
- Download Repl as .zip
- Upload it to a temp folder in this Repl
- `unzip repl.zip` in Bash
- Copy contents to /src.

Update: 7/3/2021
Changed folder strucutre, nodejs maybe unnecesary and we could just use html repl. Seems like smartest choice, thoughts?
